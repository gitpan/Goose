Revision history for Goose

0.003   29/Nov/2011
        Added import feature :Antlers. Use this to export the 'has' method. Currently only supports 'is' and 'default'.
            use Goose qw/:Antlers/;
            has => x ( is => 'ro', default => 7 );

        Very minor change, but important if you use exports. The exported subroutine was coming from Goose.pm instead of your current module.
        This has now been fixed.

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.

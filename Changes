Revision history for Goose

        A few people decided :Class was becoming redundant with the new :Antlers import (myself included). Because of this, :Class has been replaced by :Antlers and 
        'accessor' will be replaced by 'has'. This means less typing, because if you're using :Class there's a good chance you may want 'has', too. But to use them both 
        you'd need to use qw/:Class :Antlers/, now you can just ':Antlers'. Wee!

        $Class->sub_run can now run multiple subroutines with arguments. Please see documentation for more information.

        Added import feature :Antlers. Use this to export the 'has' method. Currently only supports 'is' and 'default'.
            use Goose qw/:Antlers/;
            has => x ( is => 'ro', default => 7 );

        Very minor change, but important if you use exports. The exported subroutine was coming from Goose.pm instead of your current module.
        This has now been fixed.

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
